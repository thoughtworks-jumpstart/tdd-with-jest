/*
Write a function firstNonConsecutiveNumber(array) to find the first element 
of an array that is not consecutive.

If the whole array is consecutive then return null.

The array will always have at least 2 elements and all the elements will be numbers. 
The numbers will also all be unique and in ascending order. 
The numbers could be positive or negative and the first non-consecutive 
could be either too!

Examples:
firstNonConsecutiveNumber([1, 3])             // return 3
firstNonConsecutiveNumber([1, 2, 4, 5, 6])    // return 4
firstNonConsecutiveNumber([-1, 0, 1, -10])    // return -10
firstNonConsecutiveNumber([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) // return null
